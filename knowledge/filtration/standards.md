standards:
FFP3 - catches most of viruses (N100 in US)
FFP2 - low-risk scenarios (shop) might be ok (N95 in US)

MERV:
 * 13-16 (min. particle size: 1.0-0.3µm)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_Efficiency_Reporting_Value

HEPA (for particle size 0.3µm):
 * H13 or better
 * U15 or better
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEPA

BFE:
Bacterial Filtration Efficiency [%] for 3 microns
 * 100%-(bacteria_out)/(bacteria_in)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_Filtration_Efficiency
eg. 3-layer surgical mask has BFE ~ 98%.

PFE:
Particle Filtration Efficiency [%] for 0.1 microns (typical size of a virus)
 * 100%-(particles_out)/(particles_in)
