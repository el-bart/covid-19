## about the filtration system of nanohack

NanoHack was conceived as an active/antimicrobial 3D printed face mask manufactured with active materials. We will use active filters of non-woven polypropylene (3 layers) embedded in nanocopper to get an extra protection against microorganisms.
￼
In the study by Borkow et al (2007)7, a 2.5 cm filter was designed containing a 2 cm thick top layer of 500 mg of non-woven polypropylen impregnated with 5% copper oxide particles. This study had a control that was non-woven polypropylen copper-free as a control.
Diffusion of viruses through filters containing copper oxide resulted in a significant reduction in viral titers from 0.47 log10 to 4.6 log10 depending on the virus analyzed.

According to this study, it can be concluded that a non-woven fabric filter impregnated with copper oxide is capable of generating filtration of viruses of different types, including respiratory viruses, as can be seen in the attached table.

## recommended material

In order to achieve optimum protection against the external environment, we recommend using a triple-layer non-woven polypropylene filter embedded in nano-copper developed by The Copper Company.


## CLAIMS ABOUT NANOHACK

The purpose of the NanoMask is to offer the general population a degree of protection against airborne particles and to prevent the spread of liquid aerosols that could contaminate the airways.

It is not an N95 mask. It is a face mask and should not be considered as a PPE.
If you are a healthcare professional, you should use it as a last resort device: you cannot manipulate airway such as intubation, mechanical ventilation, fiberoptic bronchoscopy and similar procedures.
You can use it in common spaces.
It should be used for a maximum of 8 hours and change the non-woven filter once a day. After handling the active filter, you should wash your hands and follow precautions as recommended by the health authority.
Nanohack is a polymer based device, we recommend using PLACTIVE® (PLA based material) for the monoblock structure and MDflex® (TPU based material) to print the outer rim. With this setup, you can have a comfortable mask with a good seal.
We understand that there may eventually be complex access to MDflex® in some parts of the world. This is why we have released a version with an integrated rim into the monoblock structure. With this solution you can obtain a structure that fits properly but that must be complemented with some additional sealant and hypoallergenic cushioned tapes for nose and cheeks, especially if it is going to be used for long periods of time.
Keep in mind also that if you leave the elastic bands very tight it can hurt you, we don’t want the use of NanoHack to be counterproductive or cause you discomfort.
The NanoHack was designed to fit a 12 cm height face very well, measured from the tip of the chin to the ocular plane, a horizontal line that passes just between the eyes, and a distance between cheekbones (measured straight above the nose) also 12 cm.
We understand that all faces are different. If your face is smaller or larger than these measurements, we suggest rescaling the model by 5% or 10% so that there is a perfect fit to your face.


## CLEANING CONSIDERATIONS

1. Washing: Wash the equipment with soap (e.g. liquid dish soap) and clean water.
2. Rinsing: Rinse the equipment completely with clean water.
3. Disinfect: Disinfect the equipment to inactivate any remaining pathogens. Use chemical disinfection if plastic part cannot tolerate 80°C. Different countries have different disinfection protocols. Here are the most accessible chemical germicides and methods:

3.1. Method 1: Alcohol is effective against influenza virus. Ethyl alcohol (70%) is a powerful broad-spectrum
germicide and is considered generally superior to isopropyl alcohol. Since alcohol is flammable, limit its use as a surface disinfectant to small surface-areas and use it in well-ventilated spaces only. Prolonged and repeated use of alcohol as a disinfectant can also cause discoloration, swelling, hardening and cracking of rubber and certain plastics.
3.2. Method 2: Most household bleach solutions contain 5% sodium hypochlorite (50, 000 parts per million available chlorine). Recommended dilution: 1:100 dilution of 5% sodium hypochlorite is the usual recommendation. Use 1-part bleach to 99 parts cold tap water (1:100 dilution) for disinfection of surfaces. Adjust ratio of bleach to water as needed to achieve appropriate concentration of sodium hypochlorite. For example, for bleach preparations containing 2.5% sodium hypochlorite, use twice as much bleach (i.e. 2 parts bleach to 98 parts water).
4. Rinsing: If using chemical disinfection, rinse with sterile or clean water (i.e. water boiled for 5 minutes and cooled). Sterile water is preferred for rinsing off residual liquid chemical disinfectant from a respiratory device that has been chemically disinfected for reuse, because tap or distilled water may harbor microorganisms that can cause pneumonia. However, when rinsing with sterile water is not feasible, instead, rinse with tap water or filtered water (i.e. water passed through a 0.2 μ filter). Disinfection by immersion is recommended with a contact time of 30 minutes.
5. Dry equipment: Follow the previous step by an alcohol rinse and forced-air drying.
6. Store: Store equipment dry in closed packages.
