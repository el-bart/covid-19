# Givewave studios - covid-19 mask

very nice model
i've printed quite a few of these for friends and family.
the best model i was able to found so far (2020-04-20).

works well with filters made out of surgical masks.
higher filtration masks might make it harder to breath in (ventilation hole is fairly small).

sealing the mask around will force all air to go through filter - that's the idea.
keep in mind though that this also means CO2 you emit while breathing will also have a "hard time" passing outside that barrier.
