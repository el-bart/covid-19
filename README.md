# COVID-19 related stuff

used to be my private collection of "interesting findings": some graphs, some papers, 3D printable models, etc...
however over time, in many conversations it turned out that other ppl are interested in these, too.
this is why it is made public.

pretty much none of these are my work - it's just a collection of interesting things, found on the internet.
i tried to provide source for all of these, though due to a "private working copy" nature of it, it might be lacking in certain places.

please note that:
* i am NOT a medical doctor
* i do this out of curiosity - not profession

ergo: you're free to enjoy it, but with a grain of salt.
if you follow any of the data/approaches, you do it on our own.
